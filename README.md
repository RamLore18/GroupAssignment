## Where to find the work
[src directory](./src)

All relevant interfaces and files are present there.
Specifically the [Calculator.java](./src/Calculator.java) and [calculator2.java](./src/calculator2.java) are the files with the calculator applications.
There are two of them simply because Calculato2.java is a handmade GUI while Calculator.java is made with the assistance of the Swing UI designer plugin.

# Thank you for your time.
